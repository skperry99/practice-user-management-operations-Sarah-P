# Introduction to SQL with MySQL

This repository contains an introductory SQL assignment focused on core commands using MySQL Workbench. The goal is to become familiar with basic data manipulation queries.

## Assignment Focus

This assignment covers the following core SQL query types:

*   **SELECT**: Retrieving data from tables.
*   **INSERT**: Adding new rows of data into tables.
*   **UPDATE**: Modifying existing data within tables.
*   **DELETE**: Removing rows of data from tables.

## Challenges

The most challenging part of this exercise was making sure the queries were properly structured to handle the specific data requirements, especially when combining conditions for more complex SELECT statements.
